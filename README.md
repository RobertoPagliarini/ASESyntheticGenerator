# ASESyntheticGenerator

We developed a computational framework to generate synthetic individuals from the input data of allele expression introduced in [1]. Our generator 
is based on the integration of mating process of organism with genetic algorithms. The method takes as
input a dataset containing, for each individual and variant, an index identifying the observed allele and the
corresponding allele-specific read count. See [2] for details about the method.
